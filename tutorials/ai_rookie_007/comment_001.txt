Hello everybody!

In this short tutorial I will show you how you can access the linked ISIC melanoma dataset
within your Kaggle python notebook.

First we have to install the fastbook module from fast dot ai with pip.

For easyness, we import everything from fastbook.

Than we have to define the directory path to the dataset which is located in the input directory.

After that you can access a reference image.

Try it on your own, you can only learn it by doing it on your own, step by step.

It is much better than your next netflix session, believe me.

Have a good day!
