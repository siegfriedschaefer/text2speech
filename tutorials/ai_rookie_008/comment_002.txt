How can we get the metadata about the dataset?

Examining it via Fileexplorer, we spot a file called train csv.

Train csv contents attributes about the melanoma images which we can use for classification.
For example for every image there is the information about the sex of the patient, how old he was,
and if the melanoma was benign or malignant.

So, how can we interpret this file? 

We will use python's pandas module for that.
