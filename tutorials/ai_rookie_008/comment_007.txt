At the current state of my knowledge, the fast ai framework wants to have its different classes sorted
in different directories.

We must reorganise the training jpeg images directory into one which contains only benign images and one
which contains the malignant ones.

Unfortunately with Kaggle, we have no write access to the input directory to reorganise the data there.
Copying our data into the working directory does not work, too, because we have not enough space to do that.

To come around this, we use a little trick to organise our files, using only symlinks to the real images and
storing them into the working directory.
