Hello everybody,

on my journey to understannd the intrinsics of Deep Learning,
I am working through fast ai's chapter 2, called "Deployment".

In this chapter we should develop our own Deep Learning Project,
following Jeremy's Howard Drivetrain Approach.

I decide to build a classifier for malignent melanomes using the
ISIC 2020 Challenge Dataset from the Kaggle Competition.

This short intro shows how easy it is to link a Dataset from Kaggle to your
own Kaggle notebook environment.

Enjoy!
