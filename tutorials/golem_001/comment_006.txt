What is the Golem Network?

Golem Network is an open-source decentralized p2p platform where everyone can use and share each other's computing power without relying on centralized entities.

It establishes a decentral marketplace for compute demands like AI and Data analytics and offers it services as a Dectralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN).

Participants of the Golem Network offer and pay these services through the utility token GLM.
