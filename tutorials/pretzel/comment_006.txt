We model now the left hand side of the pretzel by extrusing the end point and
adjusting it according to the reference image.

But you have to be very careful in switching between extrusion and moving the weigth points
because it is very easy to import to much edges and making the model to complicated.

Also remember to do the modeling in top view so that you model the pretzel in one plane.
