After we have finished the left hand side of the pretzel, we can start to model the right hand side of it
with the same method. 

Extrude the endpoint by pressing "e", 

place the weighting point in a good strategic position and manipulate the handles till
 you get a smooth curve which extrapolitate the pretzel.
