Hello everybody!

Welcome to my new Blender modeling tutorial.

Today we want to model a Swabian Pretzel in Blender which we want to use in our Vending Machine Dapp course.

The characteristic features of a Swabian pretzel are its thick belly and thin ends.

So, for a better understanding,let us first integrate our Swabian Pretzel reference image into Blender.

Press Shift A, Image, Background and select the provided Reference image.

We place it at the center of our workspace.
