It is that easy to calculate the derivative of a function at point x.

I hope you got an intuition about the functionality of the derivative of a function,
because if you understand this, you have understood the basics behind backpropagation and
one of the intrinsics of all deep learning training algorithms.

They all use backpropagation to learn by a method called stochastic gradient descent which
uses derivatives to optimize the outcome of a neural network.

But this is another story.

As always you can download this notebook from my github repository and I advice you to do it.

Understanding comes from Doing and you just need a little bit of time, VS Code and conda 
to start with your journey.

Have a good weekend!
