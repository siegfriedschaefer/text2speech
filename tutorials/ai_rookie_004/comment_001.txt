Hello everybody,

today i started with the first chapter of fast ai's course Practical Deep Learning for Coders.
After reading some introduction material, I decided to setup fast ai's jupyter notebook at 
Paperspace, which was very easy and straight forward AFTER upgrading to the Pro Plan.

It just cost 8 Dollar per month and I can really recommend it.
