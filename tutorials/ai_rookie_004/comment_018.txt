Coming to the end of this small demonstration,
you should take the following points with you:

First,
A model is just as good or bad as the data it was trained on.

Second,
A classifier model can make a failure, don't trust it alone for making serious decisions.

Third,
You can use Stable diffusion to generate an image, but plan for haluzinations.
