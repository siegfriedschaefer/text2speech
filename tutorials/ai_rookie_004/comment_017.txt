So far the model has worked very well.
But what happens if we try to let it classify something which is neither a cat nor a dog?

Have a look at the classification of our AI Rookie logo.

What? It is a cat with a possibility of 0.82?

What's going wrong here?

Well, i have got no idea, but this example demonstrates us that we have to be very careful
in getting a model for granted.

And it demonstrates us that we have to learn a lot about using these models, even the small ones.
