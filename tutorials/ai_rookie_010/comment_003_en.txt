In this YouTube short, I introduce you to my new open source K I project, 
which explores the possibility of implementing skin cancer detection locally on an Android smartphone.

I will first train a corresponding K I model in the cloud
and then try to transform this model step by step into an Android app.

This will keep all health data and analyses private and securely stored on your own smartphone.
