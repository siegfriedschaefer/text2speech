# Vending Machine Tutorial

Building the Metaverse with Web3 and 3d - Modeling is hard.

Very hard.

There's a lot of things to learn, too much for one life only, but you have to start somewhere.

So why not start building a Vending Machine. 

## A Swabian Pretzel Vending machine.

In this tutorial we will build our very first Metaverse Dapp, going through all the steps needed
to offer a Swabian Pretzel to our Dapp users.

We will build this Dapp as an Web3 mobile Application with an evm compatible blockchain as a (Micro)-service at the backend which implements the Vending machine business logic and a Babylon.js driven AR experience which implements the Frontend.

This is a live tutorial.

You can follow me on my way through it.

Don't expect a constant progress, but i try my best.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask me, but do not expect answers straight away, because i have to learn a lot, too, and i didn't have answers for everything or i have not the patience to answer.

So let's dive in.
