I will use a lot of different tools and knowledge during this course.

From 3D-Modeling software Blender over XR-engine Babylon js to Smart Contract
programming language Solidity.

I will use Github's Copilot, because it enhances my coding possibilities in any 
programming contexts i'm working in.

Don't expect me to be a Master of anything of this stuff,
and don't forget to use the most important thing above all, 
your very only soft brain matter.
