I will start with the modeling of the Swabian Pretzel in Blender.

Than i will model the Pretzel Vending Machine and try to animate some sequences.

After that we design and implement the business logic of the Vending Machine as a Smart Contract in Solidity.

What follows is putting everything together in the form of a Pretzel Dapp.

I have to admit that in the current state of the project there are some details left open.

For example:

Should we design the Pretzels as a Nft? 

What is the functionality of the Vending Machine in detail?

But at the end of the course we will be able to offer our Swabian Pretzels to the envolving Metaverse.
