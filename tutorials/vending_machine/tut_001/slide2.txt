If you are interested in this tutorial, you should have already some knowledge
about the technologies used by this tutorial.

It is easier for you to follow if you know already something about the Web3 technology stack,
Javascript coding, Smart contract development with Solidity, 3D Modeling with Blender or
working with the Babylon js Game Engine.

If you are new to this topics, it will help if you have a look at my small PWA Workshop or Blender Demos
on my Youtube channel Metaverse for you or mtvs4u.
